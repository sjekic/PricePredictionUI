st.text("Not all of the features were numerical, hence we had to perform encoding. For most we chose one-hot encoding, but some categorical features had to many options. Most of them were brands of computers, types of graphics cards, RAM and hard disks. For them, we use label encoding")

st.text("In this plot, each dot represents a product, so a laptop/computer. The x and y-axes are the first two principal components, which capture most of the variance in our original 5-Dimensional feature space. We can see from the plot that each cluster, assigend with KMeans, is represented with a different color. This visualization shows us that clusters are mostly compacted together, but a seperation is evident and PCA is still able to show groupings. Overall, we can say that our selected features yield meaningful and interpretable segments in our data. The PCA projection provides more interpretability and supports the validity of the clustering process. However, PCA is a linear method, so its ability to separate clusters with nonlinear boundaries is limited â€” which explains why a few clusters appear to blend.")
